      At Salesforce, I serve as the frontend engineer for high-stakes product demonstrations featured on the world’s largest tech stages, including <strong>Dreamforce</strong> and the <strong>Agentforce World Tour</strong>. My role is a hybrid of deep technical architecture and rapid, "zero-to-one" prototyping.
      <br><br>
      I specialize in building production-grade visualizations for Agentforce and the Salesforce PaaS/SaaS stack. These are not just "mockups", but rather stable, real-time systems designed to demonstrate the "art of the possible" with AI agents and LLM orchestration to an audience of millions. I bridge the gap between Messaging, Design, and Engineering to ensure our most advanced technical innovations are accessible, intuitive, and flawlessly executed during live keynotes.

      During my six years at DBS, I evolved from a full-stack engineer into a technical lead focused on enterprise-scale resilience and design systems. I was the Principal Developer of the bank’s primary UI component library, the foundational framework used by hundreds of engineers to build consistent, accessible, and high-performance financial applications. You may catch a glimpse of this library <a routerLink="/enterprise">here</a>.
      <br><br>
      Beyond infrastructure, I led the UX modernization of our flagship enterprise finance platforms. My work was defined by a transition from traditional full-stack engineering to a "Product-First" engineering mindset, where I specialized in data visualization, quality automation, and the translation of complex financial workflows into modern, human-centric interfaces.

      Owing to the Singaporean education system, I've received a particularly STEM focused education my whole life, not that I'm complaining. I've enjoyed and excelled in Physics and Math particularly, and went on to pursue a degree in Physics from the National University of Singapore, where I'd also picked up Computer Science.
      <br><br>
      Later in my career, I hope to combine my knowledge in STEM and skills in UX engineering to be an effective science communicator. To that end, I have built a showcase of a physics lesson in "Everyday Electricity" <a routerLink="/physics">here</a>. 
      <br><br>
      The <a routerLink="/gravity-sim">gravity simulator</a> that I'm currently building is another showcase of the marriage between my physics and UX background.

      Despite my STEM-y education, I've actively incorporated artsy hobbies in my life - these include 3D modelling, 3D printing, UX design, cartooning, baking, and playing the piano since childhood. 
      <br><br>
      I have over 8000 hours of play time on just one particular video game, Dota 2 - make of that what you will.
      <br><br>
      As for sports and outdoorsy activities, I enjoy badminton, cycling, kayaking, billiards, and a nice walk in the park.

      Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
